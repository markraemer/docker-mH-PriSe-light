# Usage
## Download or Build
find image on Docker, pull and prepare - [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/markraemer/mh-prise-light/) or
(alternatively) clone from git and build docker file `sudo docker build -t mh-prise/alpha:v1 . `

## Start
A shell script `./start-container.sh` is provided which starts the docker image in a new container. The script comes with different parameters

|sudo docker run \ | startup command|
| --- | --- |
|-v {PATH}:/var/lib/mysql \ | The framework requires a database which for persistency will be stored outside the docker container. Insert a path here, e.g. `/var/mh-prise/mysql/` |
| -v {PATH}:/mnt/data \ | The framework captures and stores data in the filesystem. Again for persistency these files are stored outside the container. Inside a path here, e.g. `/var/mH-PriSe/data` |
| -v {PATH}/conf/:/usr/src/app/config \ | The conf folder can be obtained from Git and should include all configuration files: *apps_companion.prop*, *apps_tools.prop*, *config.prop*, *epydoc.conf*. All these files are required for the framework to start. |
| -t \ | |
| -i \ | |
| -ti \ | |
|--rm \ | |
| -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \ | required to connect to host X11 |
| -e INTERFACE=wlp58s0 \ | The name of the hosts wifi card. This will be used to expose a hotspot. |
| -e OUTGOINGS=enp0s20f0u2 \ | The hosts network interface that will provide internet access. E.g. a lan connection |
| -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \ | |
| -p 3306:3306 \ | mysql port for external connections |
| -p 22:22 \ | SSH port for external connection |
| --privileged \ | required to setup network interfaces |
| --net host \ | |
| --name mh-prise \ | name of the running container |
| mh-prise/alpha:v1` | name of the image |

## Connect and Start App
connect to container and start application
`./connect.sh`
OR ssh into the running container and start mh-prise from `/usr/src/app/framework/` by running `python runner.py`
